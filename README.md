# Primal

Primal is a game inspired by Josh Wardle's
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/), but instead of words, the goal
is to guess prime numbers.

## Deployment

Primal runs entirely client-side in a web browser. To deploy it, simply copy the
files to a directory on a web server. It can even run from a local `file://`
URL.
