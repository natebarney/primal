    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>
        The goal of Primal is to guess a random five-digit prime number in six
        or fewer attempts. A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is
        not evenly divisible by any number other than 1 or itself. (Wikipedia
        has a nice article on
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number"
        target="_blank">prime numbers</a> for those unfamiliar with them.) After
        each guess is entered, its digits are colored according to the following
        rules. These colors provide clues that can inform the next guess.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Digits which do not appear in the goal number are colored
                    in grey. In the following example, the goal number contains
                    none of the guessed digits.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <table class="game">
                <tr>
                    <td class="none">1</td>
                    <td class="none">5</td>
                    <td class="none">0</td>
                    <td class="none">8</td>
                    <td class="none">9</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Digits which are in the goal number, but which are
                    incorrectly placed, are colored in yellow. In this example,
                    there is at least one 3 in the goal number, but the second
                    position does not contain a 3.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <table class="game">
                <tr>
                    <td class="none">1</td>
                    <td class="misplaced">3</td>
                    <td class="none">8</td>
                    <td class="none">5</td>
                    <td class="none">9</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Digits which are correctly placed are colored in green. In
                    this example, there is at least one 3 in the goal number,
                    and the last position contains a 3.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <table class="game">
                <tr>
                    <td class="none">1</td>
                    <td class="none">9</td>
                    <td class="none">5</td>
                    <td class="none">8</td>
                    <td class="correct">3</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Digits may occur more than once in a prime number. If a
                    digit is repeated in a guess, any instances in the correct
                    position are colored green, then any remaining instances
                    are colored yellow from left to right until either all
                    instances in the guess have been colored, or the total count
                    of colored instances in the guess matches the count of
                    instances of that digit in the goal number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this example, the goal number contains two 0's. One is
                    in the fourth position, and the other is not in the second
                    or third positions.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <table class="game">
                <tr>
                    <td class="none">1</td>
                    <td class="misplaced">0</td>
                    <td class="none">0</td>
                    <td class="correct">0</td>
                    <td class="none">7</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
    </p>

    <h1>Valid Guesses</h1>
    <p>
        By default, Primal will only allow prime numbers to be entered as
        guesses. If a non-prime number is guessed, the guess will be rejected
        with an error message. If the number guessed is composite (i.e. not
        prime, 0, or 1), the error message will display its <a target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization">prime
        factorization</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        At present, this behavior can be changed by unchecking the &ldquo;Prime
        guesses only&rdquo; checkbox. If this box isn't checked, any five-digit
        number may be guessed. This checkbox may be removed in a future version,
        requiring that guesses be prime numbers.
    </p>

    <h1>Prime Guide</h1>
    <p>
        The prime guide is a feature which assists in entering prime numbers.
        As a guess is entered, the next position to be filled will contain a
        small grid with the digits 0 through 9. If a digit can lead to a prime
        number when entered, it is colored white in the small grid. If it
        cannot, it is colored grey. This feature may be disabled by unchecking
        the &ldquo;Prime guide&rdquo; checkbox.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, the prime guide shows that the only five-digit prime
        numbers that begin with &ldquo;123&rdquo; have one of &ldquo;2&rdquo;,
        &ldquo;4&rdquo;, &ldquo;7&rdquo;, &ldquo;9&rdquo;, or &ldquo;0&rdquo; in
        the fourth position.
    </p>
    <p>
        <table class="game">
            <tr>
                <td class="entry">1</td>
                <td class="entry">2</td>
                <td class="entry">3</td>
                <td class="empty">
                    <div class="minigrid">
                        <div>1</div>
                        <div class="possible">2</div>
                        <div>3</div>
                        <div class="possible">4</div>
                        <div>5</div>
                        <div>6</div>
                        <div class="possible">7</div>
                        <div>8</div>
                        <div class="possible">9</div>
                        <div></div>
                        <div class="possible">0</div>
                        <div></div>
                    </div>
                </td>
                <td class="empty"></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>In fact, the five-digit primes beginning with &ldquo;123&rdquo; are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>123<span class="bold">0</span>1,</li>
        <li>123<span class="bold">2</span>3,</li>
        <li>123<span class="bold">2</span>9,</li>
        <li>123<span class="bold">4</span>3,</li>
        <li>123<span class="bold">4</span>7,</li>
        <li>123<span class="bold">7</span>3,</li>
        <li>123<span class="bold">7</span>7,</li>
        <li>123<span class="bold">7</span>9, and</li>
        <li>123<span class="bold">9</span>1,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>which matches the prime guide display above.</p>

    <h1>On-Screen Keyboard</h1>
    <p>
        If the device being used to play Primal has a physical keyboard (e.g. a
        computer), that can be used to enter guesses. The backspace key clears
        the most recently entered digit, and if all five digits are filled in,
        the enter or return key submits the guess.
    </p>
    <p>
        To facilitate play on devices without a physical keyboard (e.g. mobile
        phones), Primal provides an on-screen keyboard with the digits 0-9, an
        enter key (&crarr;), and a backspace key (&#9003;). It is positioned
        below the main grid, and looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <div id="keyboard" style="margin-left: 0;">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td id="0" class="available">0</td>
                    <td id="1" class="available">1</td>
                    <td id="2" class="available">2</td>
                    <td id="3" class="available">3</td>
                    <td id="4" class="available">4</td>
                    <td id="5" class="available">5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td id="enter" class="available">&crarr;</td>
                    <td id="6" class="available">6</td>
                    <td id="7" class="available">7</td>
                    <td id="8" class="available">8</td>
                    <td id="9" class="available">9</td>
                    <td id="backspace" class="available">&#9003;</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        As an aid to the player, as guessed digits are colored in the main grid,
        the corresponding key is colored the same way. If multiple instances of
        the digit are colored differently in the main grid, the on-screen
        keyboard key is colored in the priority order green, yellow, grey.
    </p>

    <h1>Seed Values, New Game, and Permalink</h1>
    <p>
        At the top of the game page, the name &ldquo;Primal&rdquo; is followed
        by a long number. This number is the seed value used by the random
        number generator to select the random prime to be guessed. Normally, the
        seed value is itself randomly selected by using sources of randomness
        provided by the web browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the seed can instead be specified in the URL query string by
        using the <span style="font-family: monospace;">seed=</span> query
        parameter. The game generates a link with this parameter, titled
        &ldquo;Permalink&rdquo;, after the current game is complete. This URL
        can be used to share a specific puzzle, if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of a game, a &ldquo;New Game&rdquo; button is provided,
        which starts a new game with a new random prime. This button clears any
        seed parameter specified in the URL query string, so it will select a
        new prime even if the game was started from a permalink.
    </p>
